### Welcome to Kevin Qian's Homepage on Github.io && A BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT<sup>very important</sup>
Unfortunately, this site is still <mark style="background-color: black; color: white; font-style: italic">under construction</mark>. What you are staring at right now could be defined as a "Place-holder"--after all, this goddamned page is automatically generated, devoid of inspiration, excitement, aesthetics and individuality. However, I would definitely pay tribute to the talented employees of Github, since they should give up their design and allow this well-formatted website template to rot in the mundane world and to be corrupted by me--a stupid, inexperienced and sloth-like piece of shit (to call me a "programmer" is equivalent to stain this title) who does not even have the knowledge of CSS and Javascript.<br>
Well, in case you must visit some website about me, check out my <a href="kunqian.bol.ucla.edu">Personal Website at UCLA</a>.
