  "body": "### Welcome to Kevin Qian's Homepage on Github.io && A BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT<sup>very important</sup>\r\nUnfortunately, this site is still <mark style=\"background-color: black; color: white; font-style: italic\">under construction</mark>. What you are staring at right now could be defined as a \"Place-holder\"--after all, this goddamned page is automatically generated, devoid of inspiration, excitement, aesthetics and individuality. However, I would definitely pay tribute to the talented employees of Github, since they should give up their design and allow this well-formatted website template to rot in the mundane world and to be corrupted by me--a stupid, inexperienced and sloth-like piece of shit (to call me a \"programmer\" is equivalent to stain this title) who does not even have the knowledge of CSS and Javascript.<br>\r\nWell, in case you must visit some website about me, check out my <a href=\"kunqian.bol.ucla.edu\">Personal Website at UCLA</a>.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently: <a href=\"ucla.edu\"><b>University of California, Los Angeles</b></a> (UCLA), <b>HSSEAS CS department</b>, Undergraduate, 1st year (expected date of graduation: some day in the spring of 2019)<br>\r\nPreviously: Huh? Why are you interested in THIS? You are NOT from <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov\">NSA</a>, right? (or maybe you ARE.)\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Current Interest\r\n<br>\r\nUnity3D Game Development<br>\r\nWeb Development<br>\r\nIOS App Development<br>\r\nMachine Learning\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n<br>\r\n--<b>Kismet Project</b>: A 2D Curtain-fire Shooting Game (A.K.A. \"Danmaku\") (January 2016--?, currently developing)<br>\r\n--...And nothing else! (Actually I built some simple iPhone Apps in 2015, but none of them went to App Store. So please ignore them)\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\n<br>\r\nKevin \"Kismet Kassimo\" Qian<br>\r\nEmail:<br>\r\n      kunqian@ucla.edu(School-related && Personal)<br>\r\n      kevinkassimo@gmail.com(Public)<br>\r\nTel: +1-(424)-371-0042<br>\r\nAddress: To those who are ignorant enough, I AM LIVING IN LOS ANGELES (otherwise how could I attend UCLA?)
